# Yodlee Integration Status & Migration Guide

## Current Status

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The Maybe Finance application currently has a **placeholder Yodlee integration** that needs to be updated for production use.

### Current Issues

1. **Outdated Gem Dependency**: The `yodlee-icious` gem (v0.0.7) is outdated and has compatibility issues with modern Rails applications
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: The gem conflicts with Rails 7.2+ due to incompatible Faraday gem versions
3. **No Active Maintenance**: The gem appears to be unmaintained and hasn't been updated recently

### What's Currently Configured

✅ **Environment Variables** - Ready for Yodlee sandbox integration:
- `YODLEE_CLIENT_ID` - Cobrand Client ID from developer portal
- `YODLEE_SECRET` - Cobrand Secret 
- `YODLEE_BASE` - Sandbox API URL (`https://sandbox.api.yodlee.com/ysl`)
- `YODLEE_FASTLINK_URL` - FastLink widget URL for sandbox
- `YODLEE_COBRAND_NAME` - Your cobrand name
- `ENABLE_YODLEE` - Feature flag to enable/disable integration

✅ **Database Schema** - Yodlee-related tables are already migrated:
- `yodlee_items` - For storing Yodlee item connections
- `yodlee_accounts` - For mapping Yodlee accounts to Maybe accounts

❌ **Working Integration** - The gem dependency is commented out due to conflicts

## Recommended Migration Path

### Phase 1: Direct HTTP API Integration

Replace the outdated `yodlee-icious` gem with direct HTTP API calls using Faraday (already in Gemfile):

```ruby
# app/services/yodlee_service.rb
class YodleeService
  include HTTParty
  
  base_uri ENV['YODLEE_BASE']
  
  def initialize
    @client_id = ENV['YODLEE_CLIENT_ID']
    @secret = ENV['YODLEE_SECRET']
    @cobrand_name = ENV['YODLEE_COBRAND_NAME']
  end
  
  def authenticate_cobrand
    # Implementation using direct HTTP calls
  end
  
  def authenticate_user(username, password)
    # Implementation using direct HTTP calls
  end
  
  # Add other Yodlee API methods as needed
end
```

### Phase 2: Modern Yodlee SDK

Consider using official Yodlee SDKs or newer community gems if they become available:

- Check [Envestnet Developer Portal](https://developer.envestnet.com/resources/yodlee/additional-documentation) for official SDKs
- Monitor RubyGems for updated Yodlee integration gems
- Consider building a custom gem if needed for the project

## Implementation Resources

### Official Yodlee Documentation
- [Yodlee Developer Portal](https://www.yodlee.com/fintech/developers/developer-portal)
- [Envestnet Developer Resources](https://developer.envestnet.com/)
- [Yodlee API Documentation](https://developer.yodlee.com/api-docs)

### Community Resources
- [yodlee-icious GitHub](https://github.com/liftforward/yodlee-icious) - For reference patterns (don't use the gem)
- [yodlee_now GitHub](https://github.com/jmajonis/yodlee_now) - Alternative implementation patterns

### Integration Points in Maybe Finance

The Yodlee integration should connect with:

1. **Account Sync System** (`app/models/concerns/syncable.rb`)
2. **Provider Registry** (`app/models/provider/registry.rb`)
3. **Plaid-like Architecture** - Follow similar patterns as the Plaid integration

## Current Workaround

For development setup, the Yodlee gem dependency is commented out in the Gemfile:

```ruby
# Yodlee Integration - manually handled via HTTP requests for now
# gem "yodlee-icious", "~> 0.0.7" # Ruby wrapper for Yodlee REST API - conflicts with faraday versions
```

All environment variables are configured in `env.local` and ready for use with a custom HTTP-based implementation.

## Action Items

- [ ] **High Priority**: Implement direct HTTP API integration using Faraday
- [ ] **Medium Priority**: Create `YodleeService` class following Maybe's provider pattern
- [ ] **Medium Priority**: Integrate with existing account sync system
- [ ] **Low Priority**: Consider building/contributing to a modern Yodlee Ruby gem
- [ ] **Documentation**: Update setup guides once new integration is complete

## Timeline Estimate

- **Direct HTTP Implementation**: 2-3 days
- **Integration with Maybe's sync system**: 1-2 days  
- **Testing and refinement**: 1-2 days

**Total estimated effort**: 4-7 days for a functional Yodlee integration
